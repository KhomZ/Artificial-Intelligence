Histogram of Oriented Gradients explained using OpenCV

HOG feature descriptor

calculated internally by OpenCV, MATLAB and other packages.




What is a feature Descriptor?
A feature descriptor is a representation of an image or an image patch that simplifies
the image by extracting useful information and throwing away extraneous information



Typically, a feature descriptor converts an image of size widh x height x 3 (channels) 
to a feature vector / array of length n.

eg.
HOG feature descriptor 
input image is of size 64 x 128 x 3
and the output feature vector is of length 3780


How to calculate HOG?

Step1 : Preprocessing
Step2 : Calculate the Gradient Images
Step3 : Calculate Histogram of Gradients in 8x8 cells
step4 : 16x16 Block Normalization
step5 : Calculate the Histogram of Oriented Gradients feature vector

Gradient 

An image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image.
It is one of the fundamental building blocks in image processing
e.g. the Canny edge detector uses image gradient for edge detection




In computer graphics, a color gradient specifies a range of position-dependent colors, usually used to fill a region. 
For example, many window managers allow the screen background to be specified as a gradient. 
The colors produced by a gradient vary continuously with position, producing smooth color transitions.
